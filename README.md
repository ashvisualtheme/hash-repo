This repository contains the official, version-specific **SHA-256 checksums** for PKP Platform (OJS/OMP/OPS) core, plugin, and theme files. It serves as the trusted, centralized baseline that our File Integrity Scanner plugin uses to detect unauthorized modifications and ensure the security of your journal's installation.

## The Role of This Repository

The **File Integrity Scanner Plugin** strengthens your OJS security by proactively scanning your application files and comparing them against the cryptographic hashes stored here. This repository is the source of truth for what your files *should* look like.

When the plugin runs its daily scan, it fetches the relevant baseline files from this repository to perform its comparison. Any deviation‚Äîwhether a file is **Modified**, **Added**, or **Deleted**‚Äîis immediately flagged and reported to the site administrator.

‚û°Ô∏è **To learn more or download the main plugin, visit the [File Integrity Scanner Plugin Repository](https://github.com/ashvisualtheme/file-integrity-scanner).**

## Contributing to the Hash Ecosystem

We encourage OJS/OMP/OPS plugin and theme developers to contribute to this security ecosystem. By adding hash baselines for your public projects, you enable thousands of PKP OJS/OMP/OPS administrators to verify the integrity of your software automatically.

### How to Add Your Hashes

Our system uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the generation of correctly formatted SHA-256 hash files.

To generate and contribute hashes for a new plugin or theme version, please follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the **Actions** tab of this repository.
2.  Select the **Generate Hash with Manual Input** workflow.
3.  Click the **Run workflow** button.
4.  Provide the required inputs:
    * **Full URL of the .tar.gz file to process**: The complete, public URL of the release archive you want to process.
    * **Plugin category for the folder structure**: The category of the plugin (e.g., `themes`, `blocks`, `generic`) to ensure the hash file is placed in the correct directory.
5.  Click **Run workflow** to start the process.

Once the workflow is complete, a new JSON hash file will be available as a downloadable artifact. Please create a pull request to add this file to the repository.
